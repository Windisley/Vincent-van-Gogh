        <p>
          Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter whose work profoundly influenced modern art. Initially, Van Gogh worked as an art dealer, but devoted himself to painting at home for 27 years. In just over a decade, he produced some 2,100 works, including approximately 860 oil paintings, marked by the intense use of vibrant colors, expressive brushstrokes, and subjects ranging from landscapes and still lifes to portraits.

        Despite his significant artistic output, Van Gogh lived in relative obscurity and financial hardship, suffering from severe mental health problems. He spent periods in psychiatric institutions, where he continued to paint. His unique style was unrecognized during his lifetime; only after his death at the age of 37 did his work gain worldwide recognition, becoming one of the most influential artists in the history of Western art.
